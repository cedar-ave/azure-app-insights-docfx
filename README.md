## Prerequisites

### Directory and site structure

#### Local machine

One site generated by DocFx per guide on a local machine (or build pipeline), e.g.:

```plaintext
source/
  product-guide-1/
    articles/
      page-1.md
      page-2.md
    templates/
    docfx.json
    index.md
    Etc.
  product-guide-2/
    articles/
      page-1.md
      page-2.md
    templates/
    docfx.json
    index.md
    Etc.
  product-guide-2a/
    articles/
      page-1.md
      page-2.md
    templates/
    docfx.json
    index.md
    Etc.
  index.md
```

Running DocFx on each directory produces:

```plaintext
source/
  product-guide-1/
    _site/
      articles/
        page-1.html
        page-2.html
      index.html
  product-guide-2/
    _site/
      articles/
        page-1.html
        page-2.html
      index.html
  product-guide-2a/
    _site/
      articles/
        page-1.html
        page-2.html
      index.html
```

#### Azure Blob structure

Contents of each local directory are published to a corresponding directory in an Azure Blob (nested directories are supported), e.g.:

Azure Storage Account > Container > Blob:

```plaintext
blob/
  product-guide-1/
    articles/
      page-1.html
      page-2.html
    index.html
  product-guide-2/
    articles/
      page-1.html
      page-2.html
    index.html
    product-guide-2a/
      articles/
        page-1.html
        page-2.html
      index.html
  index.html
```

#### Live site

Files in the Azure Blob are published to the live site following the Azure Blob's directory structure, e.g.:

```plaintext
www.<your site>.com/index.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/index.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-1.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-2.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/index.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/articles/page-1.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/articles/page-2.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/product-guide-2a/articles/page-1.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/product-guide-2a/articles/page-2.html
www.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/product-guide-2a/index.html
```

### Setup and tools

- [JavaScript code for Azure Application Insights tracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview) at the bottom of each site page
  - To do this, add the code snippet in a `scripts.tmpl.partial` file in a [custom DocFx template](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/howto_create_custom_template.html#merge-template-with-default-template)
- [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download)
- Azure Storage Account and Blob
- The Azure Blob's:
  - Storage Account name
  - Account key
  - Container name
- Site root URL

## Overview

### Purpose 1: Identify site pages with zero views

Azure Application Insights provides data only site pages with >=1 view, e.g.:

```csv
url,name,Ocurrences
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-1/index.html","Welcome",1600
"http://localhost:3000/product-guide-1/index.html","Welcome",1550
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-1/page-1.html","Settings",1425
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-1/page-2.html","Configuration | Articles",1420
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-2/page-1.html","Glossary",1415
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-2/page-1.html","Glossary - docs.<your site>.com",1413
"http://localhost:7000/product-guide-2/page-1.html","Glossary",1412
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-2/page-2.html?q=admin%20console","Administration",1400
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-1/page-1.html#options","Settings",1390
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-2/product-guide-2a/page-1.html","Intro",1375
"https://<your site>.com/product-guide-2/page-3.html","Security, permissions, and identification",1350
```

It can be helpful to know which pages have zero views.

The solution is to compare a (1) list of all pages that exist with a (2) list of pages tracked by Azure Application Insights. Any page not in both lists is assumed to have zero views.

#### (1) List of all pages that exist

When a DocFx site is generated locally (e.g., `<local machine>/product-guide-1/_site/**`), an `index.json` file is produced in `_site`. `index.json` lists all pages in the site.

`index.json` is deployed to the Azure Blob with the rest of the site (e.g., Azure Storage Account > Container > Blob > `product-guide-1/index.json`.

#### (2) List of pages tracked by Azure Application Insights

A Kusto query (`kusto_queries/content.kusto`) returns a list of pages with >=1 view. It also returns each page's view count, name, and URL. See step 2 below.

#### How the lists are compared

`usage.sh` uses the Azure CLI to download the `index.json` file from each directory (subsite) in the Azure Blob.

First, it combines each directory's (and any subdirectory's) `index.json` files into one JSON file (list 1). Next, the CSV exported from Azure Application Insights (list 2) is transformed to a JSON file. Finally, the script compares the two JSON files on URL, which is included in both lists. Pages in list 1 not included in list 2 are assumed to have zero views.

Before the comparison, the script also sums the value of page views for duplicate pages and addresses other irregularities.

##### Azure Application Insights

| page   | views |
|--------|-------|
| page-1 | 1300  |
| page-2 | 1200  |
| page-2 | 300   |
| page-4 | 200   |

##### index.json

| page   |
|--------|
| page-1 |
| page-2 |
| page-3 |
| page-4 |

##### Output

| page   | views |
|--------|-------|
| page-1 | 1300  |
| page-2 | 1500  |
| page-3 | 0     |
| page-4 | 200   |

#### Combine duplicates and sums their values

Azure Application Insights data includes data for duplicate pages. `usage.sh` combines duplicate pages and sums their views.

##### Search results and anchors

Pages reached via search results and anchors are combined and view counts summed, e.g. (for a unique guide):

- Search: `page-1.html` (800 views) and `page-1?=settings` (100 views) are merged and become `page-1.html` (900 views)
- Anchor: `page-2.html` (700 views) and `page-2.html#anchor` (50 views) are merged and become `page-2.html` (750 views)

##### Same page, different names

Pages with different names that are actually the same page are combined and view counts summed, e.g.:

| Page name in export                               | Views |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `About Product 1`                                 | 100   |
| `About Product 1 - https://docs.<your site>.com/` | 30    |
| `About Product 1 - docs.<your site>.com/`         | 200   |
| `About Product 1 \| Articles`                     | 50    |
| `About Product 1 \|Articles`                      | 10    |

becomes

| Page name in report | Views |
|---------------------|-------|
| `About Product 1`   | 390   |

##### Subsite landing pages

`usage.sh` consolidates views of a subsite's landing page. Some have a blank URL, others have a title of `index.html`, etc.

##### Irrelevant domains

`usage.sh` removes pages not on the `docs.<your site>.com` domain, e.g.:

###### Example

| Domain in export       | Views |
|------------------------|-------|
| `docs.<your site>.com` | 1000  |
| `http://127.0.0.1`     | 200   |
| `0.0.0.0`              | 100   |
| `localhost`            | 500   |
| `C:/Users`             | 100   |

becomes

| Domain in export       | Views |
|------------------------|-------|
| `docs.<your site>.com` | 1000  |

#### Page name inconsistencies

- Standardizes the case of page names, which is different for list 1 and list 2
- Removes commas in page names

### Purpose 2: Add metadata to site pages

Reporting can be enhanced when pages are categorized by guide names, tags, type of documentation (how-to, about, API reference, API conceptual, etc.), etc. It can also help to identify which pages are landing pages, etc.

If the path in the `hrefFull` key in `content.json` (object 1) includes the string in the `path` key in `contentKey.json` (object 2), all keys in object 2 are added to object 1.

#### Example

##### `contentKey.json`

```json
[
  {
    "path": "product-guide-1/",
    "guide": "product-guide-1",
    "tag": "how-to"
  },
  {
    "path": "product-guide-2/articles/home.html",
    "guide": "product-guide-2",
    "tag": "home-page"
  },
  {
    "path": "/api/",
    "guide": "api",
    "restApiSubGuide": identity,
    "tag": "restApireference"
  }
]
```

##### Example output

```json
[
  {
    "guide": "product-guide-1",
    "hrefFull": "https://docs.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-1.html",
    "hrefSimple": "articles/product-guide-1/page-1.html",
    "hrefSubsite": "product-guide-1",
    "name": "page 1",
    "tag": "how-to",
    "views": 780
  },
  {
    "guide": "product-guide-1",
    "hrefFull": "https://docs.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-2.html",
    "hrefSimple": "articles/product-guide-1/page-2.html",
    "hrefSubsite": "product-guide-1",
    "name": "page 2",
    "tag": "how-to",
    "views": 625
  },
  {
    "guide": "product-guide-2",
    "hrefFull": "https://docs.<your site>.com/product-guide-2/articles/home.html",
    "hrefSimple": "product-guide-2/articles/home.html",
    "hrefSubsite": "product-guide-2",
    "name": "welcome",
    "tag": "home-page",
    "views": 550
  },
  {
    "guide": "api",
    "hrefFull": "https://docs.<your site>.com/api/identity/ping.html",
    "hrefSimple": "api/identity/ping.html",
    "hrefSubsite": "api",
    "name": "Ping",
    "restApiSubGuide": identity,
    "tag": "restApireference",
    "views": 410
  },
  {
    "guide": "api",
    "hrefFull": "https://docs.<your site>.com/api/identity/feature-toggles.html",
    "hrefSimple": "api/identity/feature-toggles.html",
    "hrefSubsite": "api",
    "name": "feature toggles",
    "restApiSubGuide": identity,
    "tag": "restApireference",
    "views": 300
  }
]
```

\* `guide` vs. `subsite`: `guide` is useful if the site directory setup is `.../subsite/articles/product-guide-2/page-1.html`.

### Purpose 3: Gather data by individual page view

In Azure Application Insights, a Kusto query (`kusto_queries/users.kusto`) returns the following data on each page view, e.g.:

```csv
"timestamp [UTC]",name,url,"user_Id",duration,"client_City","client_StateOrProvince","client_CountryOrRegion","client_Browser","client_OS","session_Id",itemType,"operation_Id",performanceBucket,"count_sum"
"10/30/2022, 7:54:05.267 PM","Page 1","https://docs.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-1.html",abcd,511,Auburn,Washington,"United States","Chrome 106.0","Mac OS X 10.15","abc1234",pageView,abc1234,"500ms-1sec",1
"10/29/2022, 10:50:00.100 AM","Page 1","https://docs.<your site>.com/product-guide-1/articles/page-1.html",abcd,520,Cleveland,Ohio,"United States","Chrome 105.0","Windows 10","abc1234",pageView,abc1234,"500ms-1sec",1
"10/29/2022, 10:48:00.001 AM","Ping","https://docs.<your site>.com/api/identity/ping.html",abcd,520,Tokyo,,Japan,"Firefox 106.0","Android","abc1234",pageView,abc1234,"3sec-7sec",1
```

#### Combine duplicates

`usage.sh` resolves the following issues in the export:

- [Duplicate pages due to search results and anchors](#search-results-and-anchors)
- [Same page, different names](#same-page-different-names)
- [Irrelevant domains](#irrelevant-domains)

#### Standardize browsers

Similar to the method using [`contentKey.json`](#purpose-2-add-metadata-to-site-pages) to add metadata to pages, a `browserKey.json` file standardizes browser names based on specified strings, e.g.:

```json
[
    {
        "browserKey": "Edg",
        "browserGeneral": "Edge"
    },
    {
        "browserKey": "Mobile Safari",
        "browserGeneral": "Safari Mobile"
    }
]
```

If the browser reported by Azure Application Insights is `Edg`, `usage.sh` identifies from `osBrowser.json` that `Edg` includes the string `Edg` (as named in `osBrowser`) and adds an `osBrowser` category.  

#### Standardize operating systems

The Azure Application Insights export may include operating systems like:

- `Windows 8.1`
- `Windows 10`
- `Mac OS X 10.13`
- `Mac OS X 10.15`
- `iOS 15.6`
- `iOS 15.7`
- `Linux`
- `Android`
- Etc.

It can be helpful to understand the operating systems used on a brand level instead of a detailed version.

A `osKey.json` file reduces the longer version name to a brand name based on a string in the version name, e.g.:

```
[
    {
        "osKey": "Windows",
        "osGeneral": "Windows"
    },
    {
        "osKey": "Mac OS",
        "osGeneral": "Mac OS"
    }
]
```

If the operating system reported by Azure Application Insights is `Windows 10`, `usage.sh` identifies from `osKey.json` that `Windows 10` includes the string `Windows` (as named in `osKey`) and adds an `osGeneral` category.  

#### Provide way to join data if guide name in path changes

If a guide name changes by way of the directory path, this step adds a value to join on later in analytics software. For example, if Product ABC is renamed to Product DEF, the directory name may change accordingly from `/ABC` to `/DEF`. That means the URL for a page in the first directory changes from `https://docs.<your site>.com/product-abc/about.html` to `https://docs.<your site>.com/product-def/about.html`. Join on `joinPath` in both `content.json` or `users.json` to see views or other data combined from both pages.

`guideKey.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "existingPath": "old-guide-name-in-path-1",
    "joinPath": "new-guide-name-in-path-1"
  },
  {
    "existingPath": "old-guide-name-in-path-2",
    "joinPath": "new-guide-name-in-path-2"
  },
]
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Export data from Azure Application Insights

1. Go to Azure Application Insights > `Logs`.
2. Copy and paste the contents of `kusto_queries/content.kusto` into the query field.
3. Click `Run`.
4. Export all rows as a CSV file to a local `azure_exports` directory.
5. Rename the exported file according to the table below.
6. Repeat steps for `kusto_queries/users.kusto`.

| Kusto query                 | Rename the export to |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| kusto_queries/content.kusto | content.csv          |
| kusto_queries/users.kusto   | users.csv            |

### Step 2: Process the data

1. In `usage.sh`, define the empty variables, e.g.:

```
storageAccountName="" #Azure Storage account name
accountKey="" #Azure Storage account key
containerName="" #Azure Storage container name
siteUrl="" #Example: docs.<my site>.com
```

2. In `dirsKey.json`, add directory names and paths in the Azure Blob, e.g.:

```
[
  {
    "blobDirName": "product-guide-1",
    "blobDirPath": "product-guide-1"
  },
  {
    "blobDirName": "product-guide-1a",
    "blobDirPath": "product-guide-1/product-guide-1a"
  }
]
```

3. Execute the script locally:

```
./usage.sh
```

### Final output

- `content.json`
- `users.json`

## Notes

- By default, Azure Application Insights stores only 90 days of data.
- Why the scripts transform the data from CSV to JSON: The Azure Application Insights export is CSV. `index.json` in the Azure Blob is JSON. Combining the two data sources as JSON enables cleaner processing and sums values of consolidated pages.
- The process could be streamlined by creating a [continuous export of Azure Application Insights data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/export-telemetry#setup), storing it in a blob, and executing this Bash script inside an Azure DevOps pipeline YAML file.
